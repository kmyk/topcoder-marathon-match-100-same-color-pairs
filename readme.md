# TopCoder Marathon Match 100: SameColorPairs

<https://community.topcoder.com/longcontest/?module=ViewProblemStatement&rd=17143&pm=14889>

## algorithm

The main algorithm is: split the board into chunks and do simulated annealing chunkwise.

Doing simulated annealing is the typical one.
Splitting boards is effective since cases with moderately small areas are easy.
